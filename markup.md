  - Floating player photos
  - Cricket-themed animations
- Accessibility: Include alt text for all images.
- Performance: Optimize photo file sizes before attaching.

## Deployment instructions (Vercel)

1. Once the site is designed in Cursor, export it as a deployable web project.
2. Create a Vercel account at [https://vercel.com](https://vercel.com).
3. Connect your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository containing the site.
4. Import the project into Vercel.
